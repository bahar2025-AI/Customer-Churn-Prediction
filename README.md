# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a fictional streaming company, StreamFlix. It demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Objective**: Predict customer churn and identify key drivers of churn using real-world business logic.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Feature Importance Analysis**
- **Comparison of Model Performance**

## 📈 Results

- XGBoost outperformed other models in overall accuracy and F1-score.
- Features such as `Tenure` and `Monthly Charges` were highly predictive.

## 📁 Files

- `ChurnCustomer_Enhanced_For_GitHub.ipynb`: Complete notebook with code, visualizations, and model comparison
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries used

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Build a dashboard with Streamlit for interactive churn scoring
- Deploy model as a REST API
